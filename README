The sitehome package is largely just a hack to the sample package.
In order to get it running, follow the instructions later in this
file. If you have any questions, get ahold of lugie on IRC.

Here is how you get bitweaver to go to its home directory upon 
first visit:

1. Install the package as usual and set proper permissions.

2. Visit the administration panel, then go to the 
   Kernel > Features screen.

3. Click on the Homepage Settings tab, then choose "Sitehome" as
   the home package.
   
   This is will result in people ending up at 
   http://mydomain.com/sitehome/ when visiting
   http://mydomain.com/. Users will also be directed here after
   logging in or out.

4. In order to get visitors to stay at your site root, see the
   file index.php.example. This file *should* work by just
   putting it in the root of your bw install and replacing the
   existing index.php file. Make sure you back up, just in case!
